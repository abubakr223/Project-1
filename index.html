    <h3>A Note on RUGBY</h3>
    <p>Rugby is played throughout the world by men and women, boys and girls. Players are attracted to Rugby because of its unique character-building values.

Our sport is built upon the principles of camaraderie, fair play, respect and teamwork. Every player knows these principles are more important than winning or losing.

From the earliest steps in our sport, players are taught the basics of playing fair, enjoying the game and respecting the officials and opponents alike.</p>
